               /*
                    The original code snippet you provided attempts to swap odd and even bits in an unsigned integer by iterating over the bits of the number, extracting pairs of bits, and swapping them. The runtime error you encountered was likely due to the way the bits were being manipulated and updated in the original version.
                    In the original snippet, this line:
                         `n = n - (a << i) - (b << (i + 1)) + (b << i) + (a << (i + 1));`
                    attempts to directly manipulate the bits by adding and subtracting the values shifted to their respective positions. This approach can lead to underflow or overflow issues because subtracting a bit that wasn't originally set in the position it's being subtracted from could cause the unsigned integer to wrap around (since unsigned integers cannot represent negative values).

                    The corrected version of the code:
                         `n = n - (a << i) - (b << (i + 1)) + (a << (i + 1)) + (b << i);`
                    is still conceptually similar but it correctly swaps `a` and `b`. The critical improvement here isn't in the math itself (since the corrected version essentially performs the same mathematical operations but with the correct order of `a` and `b` for the swap), but rather in ensuring the operations accurately reflect the intention of swapping the bits.

                    The key reason the corrected code works without runtime errors is more subtle and has to do with ensuring the bit manipulations correctly swap the bits without accidentally creating an intermediate state that could be misinterpreted or result in an illegal operation (like underflow or overflow in the context of unsigned arithmetic).
